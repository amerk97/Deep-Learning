# Deep-Learning

**Project 1:** Implementation of ANN/Backpropagation using Numpy, including a datagenerator.

**Project 2:** Implementation of CNN using Numpy (not finished), including a datagenerator.

**Project 3:** Semi supervised learning with a simple Autoencoder in PyTorch, including t-SNE plots and visuals. 

**Project 4:** Implementation of AutoEncoder (AE), Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch. Includes a variety of performance measures, anomaly detection and visuals.
